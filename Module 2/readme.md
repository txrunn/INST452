## Module 2: Reproducible Research Principles and Pipelines

### What is Reproducible Research?

- Defined as research that can be exactly replicated using the original data, code, and documentation.
- It proves the correctness of results and provides transparency in the research process.

### Types of Reproducible Research

- **Computational**: Involves code, software, and hardware details.
- **Empirical**: Pertains to data from scientific experiments, which should be publicly available.
- **Statistical**: Concerns the use of specific statistical tests and parameters.

### Tools for Reproducible Research

- **Version Control**: Tracks and recalls changes over time (e.g., GitHub).
- **Literate Programming**: Combines code and narrative to produce comprehensive documents (e.g., RStudio's knitr).
